Extracellular Electrical Stimulation II: Computational Validation and
Numerical Results" (and are also available from the journal web site:)

There are four COMSOL files that can be used to generate the finite
element simulation of the extracellular electrical stimulation. These
files corresponds to the two cases, current density and voltage
boundary conditions, presented in the paper. A separate COMSOL file
exist for longitudinal and transverse modes of stimulation. To open
and run these files COMSOL 4.2a or higher is required. The user can
sweep desired parameters if required. It should be noted that to run
these files you require high amount of memory.

There are four MATLAB files that simulates the theoretical results
presented in this paper. These files generate the figures presented in
the paper. To run these files MATLAB software package is required.
